# CoAP-factory-monitoring
Industrial object modelling using CoAP protocol and Californium framework

## Description
CoAP-factory-monitoring implements a possible IIoT scenario for factory data exchange in an Industry 4.0 perspective with CoAP protocol using the Californium framework.
The mains goals of this project are:
- Production monitoring in a manufacturing plant from different company levels
- Data distribution inside the plant using CoAP protocol for future data analysis and predictive maintenance
- Model different data acquisition devices for hiding low level field communication protocol implementation details
